Virtualization software that makes developing and deploying applications much easier.

Packages application with all necessary dependencies, configs, system tools, and runtime. 

Portable artifact, easily shared & distributed.

Docker Images vs Docker Containers

images:
- An executable application artifact
- Includes app source code, but also complete environment configuration
- Add envieronment variables, create directories, files, etc...


Containers:
- Running instance of an image.
- You may run multiple containers from one image.


---

Useful docker CLI commands
``` $ docker images ```
- Lists of local images

``` $ docker ps ```
- List of local (running) containers

``` $ docker ps -a ```
- List of all local containers

``` $ docker pull [NAME]:[TAG] ```
- downloads the image of the named registry.  Image tag can be specified for a certain version, else it can be left empty to download the latest version.

``` $ docker run [NAME]:[TAG] ```
- CREATES a container from the given image and starts it.

``` $ docker run -d [NAME]:[TAG] ```
- Creates a container from the given image and starts it.  The container will run in the background.  Will print the container id and then detaches the docker process from the terminal.

``` $ docker logs [CONTAINER ID] ```
- Will print out application logs to the container.

``` $ docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...] ``` 
- Stops one or more containers

``` $ docker run -p [LOCAL_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT] [NAME]:[TAG] ```
- ex. -p 9000:80.  Will allow user access to the container in port 9000.  Note: only one service may run on a specific port on the host (for this example, only one service can run on port 9000).

``` $ docker run --name [CONTAINER_NAME] [NAME]:[TAG] ```
- CREATES a container from the given image and starts it.  The container will now have a user-selected name rather than a random one.

``` $ ^C ```
- exits and container process is shut down

---

Docker Registries

- A storage & distribution system for docker images.
- Official images available from applications like Redis, Mongo, Postgres, etc..
- Official images are maintained by the software authors or in collaboration w/ the docker community.
- Docker hosts one of the biggest docker registry: Docker Hub

Registry vs Repository

AWS ECR 
Docker registry:
- A service providing storage
- Collection of repositories.

Docker repository:
Collection of related images with same name but different versions.

---

Container port vs host port

- App inside container runs in an isolated docker network.
- Expose the container port to the host (the machine the container runs on).

Port Binding: Bind the container's port to the host's port to make the service available to the outside world.
